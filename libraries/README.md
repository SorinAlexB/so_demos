# Libraries

Libraries can be statically-linked or dynamically-linked, creating statically-linked executables and dynamically-linked executables. Typically, the executables found in modern operating systems are dynamically-linked, given their reduced size and ability to share libraries at runtime. 

## Statically-linked libraries

In static linking, the code is tailored to executable at compile time. This will cause the executable to have a bigger dimension overall, but also will have some advantages. 


## Dynamically-linked libraries

Dynamic linking result in calling the specified libraries at call time, without embedding them at compile time. This will cause the executable to have less memory.
